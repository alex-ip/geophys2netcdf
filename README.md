# geophys2netcdf
Script to translate gridded geophysics data to NetCDF and populate file with ACDD metadata attributes.
This script grew in scope from only reading metadata from files to reading metadata from GA's CSW catalogue service.
It is intended to add more subclasses for different file types, since each one will have different requirements.
